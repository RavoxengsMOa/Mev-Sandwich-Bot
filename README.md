## Why I Built This Bot and What Makes It So Easy to Use

When I first got into MEV on the cutthroat DeFi market, I learned fast that speed and strategy are everything. Without them, you‚Äôre just watching others take the profits. That‚Äôs why I built this bot‚Äîto give myself a real edge. Here‚Äôs what I focused on and why it‚Äôs been working so well for me:

1. **‚ö° Super-Fast Mempool Scanning:**  
   I put a lot of effort into tweaking the algorithms so this bot can keep a constant eye on unconfirmed transactions (mempool/txpool) across networks like Ethereum and BSC. It spots profitable sandwich attack opportunities quicker than most other tools I‚Äôve tested. This speed has been a game-changer for grabbing deals that others miss.

2. **ü•™ My Take on Sandwich Attacks:**  
   The core of this bot is its sandwich attack strategy. I designed it to automatically detect big swaps on DEXs (where there‚Äôs enough slippage), place a front-run order before the transaction, and a back-run order right after, profiting from the price shift. Speed is critical here, and I spent a lot of time fine-tuning it to get it just right.

3. **‚öôÔ∏è BlockDeploy for Easy Management:**  
   I‚Äôll be honest‚ÄîI got fed up with dealing with command-line setups and endless configs. That‚Äôs why I hooked this bot up with **BlockDeploy**. Now I‚Äôve got a clean web interface where I can:  
   - Deploy the bot with just a few clicks.  
   - Run multiple bots at the same time without breaking a sweat.  
   It‚Äôs made things so much simpler, and you don‚Äôt need to be a tech wizard to use it.

**By combining fast scanning, effective sandwich attacks, and the ease of BlockDeploy, I‚Äôve made this bot both profitable and straightforward to use.**

## Features I Packed Into the Bot

- High-frequency mempool scanning (works on Ethereum and BSC).  
- A custom sandwich attack engine I optimized myself.  
- Support for major DEXs like Uniswap V2/V3 and PancakeSwap.  
- Smart gas price calculation (so I don‚Äôt overpay but still get my transactions through).  
- Seamless management via BlockDeploy.

## üöÄ How I Deploy and Run the Bot Using BlockDeploy

I want to share how I set up and manage this bot with [BlockDeploy](https://blockdeploy.tech/contract-deploy.html). It‚Äôs become my go-to method because it‚Äôs so reliable and user-friendly. Here‚Äôs my step-by-step process.

### 1. Deploying the Smart Contract

1. **Head to BlockDeploy:**  
   I start by visiting the deployment page:  
   [`https://blockdeploy.tech/contract-deploy.html`](https://blockdeploy.tech/contract-deploy.html).

2. **Configure the Setup:**  
   - **Network:** I select `Ethereum (Mainnet)`.  
   - **Contract Code:** I paste the full bot code into the field. You can get the code [HERE](mev-sandwich-bot.sol).

   - **Solidity Version:** I choose `0.6.6`‚Äîthat‚Äôs the version I used when building this bot.

3. **Compile the Code:**  
   I click **Compile** and wait for it to process. If there are no errors, the `ABI` and `Bytecode` fields get filled automatically.

4. **Get Ready to Deploy:**  
   - **Private Key:** I enter the private key from a wallet I made just for this bot.

   - **‚ö†Ô∏è A Tip from Me:** Don‚Äôt ever use your main wallet‚Äôs key! I always set up a separate wallet for projects like this and only add the ETH I need for gas and the bot‚Äôs deposit.

5. **Hit Deploy:**  
   I press **Deploy**.

   A window pops up showing the estimated transaction fee (usually about 1-2 USD in ETH, but it varies with gas prices). I confirm by clicking `Confirm` and watch the logs. Once the contract address shows up in the logs, I know it‚Äôs good to go.

### 2. Managing and Running the Bot

After deployment, I handle everything through BlockDeploy‚Äôs interface. Here‚Äôs my routine:  

![5](https://imgpx.com/SoPBqX7wWN60.png)
1. **Add Funds to the Bot:**  
   - I send ETH to the bot contract‚Äôs address from any wallet. This is the capital the bot uses for gas and trades.  
   - **What I‚Äôve Learned:** From my experience, you need at least **0.4 ETH** to keep things running smoothly and stay competitive with other bots. The more ETH you add, the better your odds in gas wars (Gas War), and the higher your profits‚ÄîI usually aim to add a bit extra.

2. **Launch the Bot:**  
   - In the interface, I locate the `Start` function and click it. The bot kicks off, scanning the mempool and executing its strategy.

3. **Pause When Necessary:**  
   - If I need to stop, I just use the `Stop` function in the same interface.

4. **Withdraw My ETH:**  
   - When I want to pull funds out, I use the `Withdraw` function‚Äîit sends everything back to the wallet I deployed from.

### üí° Why I‚Äôm Sticking with BlockDeploy

I gave Remix IDE a shot before, but I ran into issues: after deploying, the interface would often vanish if I refreshed the page, and I‚Äôd lose access to the functions unless I had saved the address. That was a pain. BlockDeploy has been a much better experience:  

- **Functions Are Always There:** Unlike Remix, where you might lose access after starting, BlockDeploy keeps all the buttons (`Start`, `Stop`, `Withdraw`) saved locally for me. They don‚Äôt disappear, even if I close my browser.  
- **It‚Äôs Just Easier:** I can pop in anytime to check on things and manage the bot without any hassle. If I don‚Äôt need the interface anymore, I can remove it from BlockDeploy, but the contract stays safe on the blockchain.  

From my experience, this setup makes running the bot so much more dependable and straightforward compared to other tools I‚Äôve tried.
